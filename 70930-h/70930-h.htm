<p>The autobiography of <span class="smcap">Miss Adams</span> is written with
the modesty and unobtrusiveness which distinguished
her character. It appears as if composed reluctantly,
under the feeling that the community could hardly
care to know anything about the struggles, disappointments,
hopes and purposes of an individual so humble
as herself. She undertook the task at the request
of some of her friends, who thought that the circumstances
of her life, and the traits of her character,
well deserved to be remembered. But her
principal motive in executing it, was to leave it as a
legacy, which she hoped might be of some small
benefit to an aged and very infirm sister, to whose
comfort she had devoted her little savings for many
years. It presents a lithographic drawing of herself,
which will recall the features of her mind to those
who knew her, and give some idea of them to those
who did not.</p>

<p>The continuation of her life is by a lady, one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</span>
those friends whose kindness she has acknowledged
with warm gratitude towards the conclusion of her
own narrative. It could not have been confided to
better hands. The discrimination and delicacy with
which the retiring virtues, and nicer shades of her
character are delineated and produced, will explain
to those who did not know her, what was the charm
that drew genius and wealth, and youth and beauty,
to minister with so much interest to the infirmities of
a poor old woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Adams</span> was indeed deserving of such interest.
Her life is, in many respects, full of instruction.
Among those who have overcome great and peculiar
difficulties in the pursuit of knowledge, she holds a
distinguished place. She became a literary woman,
when literature was a rare accomplishment in our
country. She has produced one work, her History
of Religions, which is the best of its kind, eminent
for its great impartiality. But it was not merely for
her powers of mind that she was remarkable, but for
her warm affections, her glow of gratitude, and her
childlike simplicity. It is honorable to the community
in which she lived, that an individual, destitute
as she was of all adventitious claims to distinction,
should have been properly estimated and respected.</p>

she left the charge of publishing her manuscript.</p>

<p>Being arrived at an age in which I cannot
reasonably expect my life will be long continued,
at the request of a highly esteemed
friend I am about to give a concise outline
of my past life; notwithstanding I am
sensible that a retrospect of past errors, faults
and misfortunes, will be exceedingly painful.</p>

<p>I was born in Medfield, a country town
about eighteen miles from Boston. My father
early imbibed a love of literature, and prepared
to enter the university. But as his
constitution then appeared to be very infirm,
and he was an only son, his parents were
strenuously opposed to his leaving them.
Accordingly, to his inexpressible disappointment,
he was obliged to settle upon their large
farm, without a suitable knowledge of, or
taste for, agricultural pursuits. This induced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
him to open a shop, for the sale, principally,
of English Goods and Books. His taste
for reading continued unabated till his death,
which took place at the advanced age of
eightyeight years.</p>

<p>From my infancy I had a feeble constitution;
in particular, an extreme weakness
and irritability in my nervous system. Hence
I can recollect uneasiness and pain previous
to any pleasurable sensations. My mother
was an excellent woman, and deservedly esteemed
and beloved; but as her own health
was delicate, and she possessed great tenderness
and sensibility, I was educated in all the
habits of debilitating softness, which probably
added to my constitutional want of bodily
and mental firmness.</p>

<p>My father’s circumstances then appeared
affluent, and it was not supposed I should be
reduced to the necessity of supporting myself
by my own exertions. Partly from ill
health, and an early singularity of taste, I
took no pleasure in the amusements to
which children are generally much attached.
My health did not even admit of attending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
school with the children in the neighborhood
where I resided. The country schools, at
that time, were kept but a few months in
the year, and all that was then taught in
them was reading, writing and arithmetic.
In the summer, the children were instructed
by females in reading, sewing, and other
kinds of work. The books chiefly made use
of were the Bible, and Psalter. Those who
have had the advantages of receiving the rudiments
of their education at the schools of
the present day, can scarcely form an adequate
idea of the contrast between them, and
those of an earlier age; and of the great improvements
which have been made even in
the common country schools. The disadvantages
of my early education I have experienced
during life; and, among various others,
the acquiring a very faulty pronunciation;
a habit contracted so early, that I cannot
wholly rectify it in later years.</p>

<p>In my early years I was extremely timid,
and averse from appearing in company. Indeed,
I found but few with whom I could
happily associate. My life, however, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
not devoid of enjoyment. The first strong
propensity of my mind which I can recollect,
was an ardent curiosity, and desire to acquire
knowledge. I remember that my first idea of
the happiness of Heaven was, of a place
where we should find our thirst for knowledge
fully gratified. From my predominant taste
I was induced to apply to reading, and as my
father had a considerable library, I was enabled
to gratify my inclination. I read with
avidity a variety of books, previously to
my mind’s being sufficiently matured, and
strengthened, to make a proper selection. I
was passionately fond of novels; and, as I
lived in a state of seclusion, I acquired false
ideas of life. The ideal world which my
imagination formed was very different from
the real. My passions were naturally strong,
and this kind of reading heightened my sensibility,
by calling it forth to realize scenes
of imaginary distress. I was also an enthusiastic
admirer of poetry; and as my memory,
at an early period, was very tenacious, I
committed much of the writings of my favorite
poets to memory, such as Milton, Thomson,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
Young, &amp;c. I did not, however, neglect
the study of history and biography, in each
of which kind of reading I found an inexhaustible
fund to feast my mind, and gratify my curiosity.</p>

<p>Another source of my enjoyments in early
life was an ardent admiration of the beauties
of nature. This enthusiasm was heightened
by the glowing descriptions of poetic
writers, and I entered into all their feelings.
This taste has continued through life. At the
present time, when age and experience have
in some measure repressed the warmth of my
feelings, and while I am now writing, I
should be more delighted with beautiful rural
prospects, and fine flowers, than when in
early life I used to be enraptured with contemplating
the sublime and beautiful in the
works of creation.</p>

<p>My early life was diversified with few
events, and those of a painful nature. The
loss of my excellent mother, which happened
when I had reached my tenth year, was
the first severe trial I was called to suffer.
When her death took place, I was at an age<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
when maternal direction is of the greatest
importance, particularly in the education of
daughters. Soon after, I was bereaved of
an aunt, who was attached to me with almost
maternal fondness. A few years after,
my father failed in trade, in consequence of
which I was reduced to poverty, with a constitution
and early habits which appeared invincible
obstacles to my supporting myself
by my own exertions. Instead of that gayety,
which is often attendant on youth, I was
early accustomed to scenes of melancholy
and distress; and every misfortune was enhanced
by a radical want of health, and firmness
of mind. My life passed in seclusion,
with gloomy prospects before me, and surrounded
with various perplexities from which
I could not extricate myself. The solitude
in which I lived was, however, to me, preferable
to society in general; and to that,
and to my natural singularity, I must impute
that awkwardness of manners, of which I
never could divest myself at an advanced period
of life. A consciousness of this awkwardness
produced a dislike to the company of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
strangers. Those who have been accustomed
to general society when young, can scarcely
imagine the trembling timidity I felt, when
introduced to my superiors in circumstances
and education. I, however, enjoyed society
upon a small scale. I had a few dear friends,
(for novels had taught me to be very romantic,)
who were chiefly in indigent circumstances,
and like myself had imbibed a taste for
reading, and were particularly fond of poetry
and novels. Most of them wrote verses,
which were read and admired by the whole
little circle. Our mutual love of literature,
want of fortune, and indifference to the society
of those whose minds were wholly uncultivated,
served to cement a union between
us, which was interrupted only by the removal
of the parties to distant places, and dissolved
only by their death. Yet I soon
experienced this melancholy change. One
after another became victims to the King of
Terrors, till our little society was greatly
diminished; and I deeply felt these bereavements
which were irreparable.</p>

<p>Still, however, I was blessed with a sister of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
similar taste and sentiments, but very different
in her disposition. I was warm and irritable
in my temper; she, placid and even.
I was fluctuating and undecided; she, steady
and judicious. I was extremely timid; she
blended softness with courage and fortitude.
I was inclined to be melancholy, though
sometimes in high spirits; she was uniformly
serene and cheerful. I placed the strongest
reliance upon her judgment, and as she
was older than myself, she seemed the maternal
friend, as well as the best of sisters.
In short, ‘she was my <em>guide</em>, my <em>friend</em>, my
<em>earthly all</em>.’</p>

<p>As I was too feeble to engage in any laborious
employments, I found considerable
leisure for reading; and as my happiness
chiefly consisted in literary pursuits, I was
very desirous of learning the rudiments of Latin,
Greek, geography, and logic. Some gentlemen
who boarded at my father’s offered
to instruct me in these branches of learning
gratis, and I pursued these studies with indescribable
pleasure and avidity. I still,
however, sensibly felt the want of a more systematic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
education, and those advantages which
females enjoy in the present day. Yet as I
always read with great rapidity, perhaps
few of my sex have perused more books
at the age of twenty than I had. Yet
my reading was very desultory, and novels
engaged too much of my attention. Though
my seclusion from the world preserved me
from many temptations which are incident
to young people, I was perhaps more exposed
to errors of the understanding, than those
who in early life have mixed more with the
world. Time and experience have led me
to see the falsity of many of my early opinions,
and ideas, and made me sensible that
they were the source of a large share of
the misfortunes of my following life.</p>

</div>


<p>Until I had attained the twentieth year
of my age, my reading had chiefly consisted
of works of imagination and feeling; such as
novels and poetry. Even the religious works
I perused were chiefly devotional poetry, and
such works as Mrs Rowe’s Devout Exercises,
and the lives of persons who were eminently
distinguished for their piety. I was almost
a stranger to controversial works, and
had never examined the points in dispute between
different denominations of Christians.
But at length an incident in my life gave a
different turn to my literary pursuit.</p>

<p>While I was engaged in learning Latin and
Greek, one of the gentlemen who taught me
had by him a small manuscript from Broughton’s
Dictionary, giving an account of Arminians,
Calvinists, and several other denominations
which were most common. This awakened
my curiosity, and I assiduously engaged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
myself in perusing all the books which I
could obtain, which gave an account of the
various sentiments described. I soon became
disgusted with the want of candor in the
authors I consulted, in giving the most unfavorable
descriptions of the denominations
they disliked, and applying to them the names
of heretics, fanatics, enthusiasts, &amp;c. I therefore
formed a plan for myself, made a blank
book, and wrote rules for transcribing, and
adding to, my compilation. But as I was
stimulated to proceed only by curiosity, and
never had an idea of deriving any profit from
it, the compilation went on but slowly, though
I was pressed by necessity to make every exertions
in my power for my immediate support.
During the American revolutionary war, I
learned to weave bobbin lace, which was then
saleable, and much more profitable to me than
spinning, sewing or knitting, which had previously
been my employment. At this period
I found but little time for literary pursuits.
But at the termination of the American
war, this resource failed, and I was again
left in a destitute situation. My health did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
not admit of my teaching a school, and I
was glad to avail myself of every opportunity
of taking any kind of work which I
could do, though the profit was very small,
and inadequate to my support. One pleasing
event occurred in this gloomy period. I
had the satisfaction of teaching the rudiments
of Latin and Greek to three young gentlemen,
who resided in the vicinity. This was
some advantage to me. Besides, it was a
pleasant amusement. One of these young
gentlemen was the <abbr title="reverend.">Rev.</abbr> <abbr title="mister">Mr</abbr> Clark, of Norton,
who pursued his studies with me till he entered
Cambridge University, and has continued
his friendship for me during life; and
his uniform excellent character I have ever
highly appreciated.</p>

<p>The difficulty of taking in such kinds of
work as I could do, for I was not, like my
sister, ingenious in all kinds of needle work,
induced me, as the last resort, to attend to my
manuscript, with the faint hope that it might
be printed, and afford me some little advantage.
I was far from being sanguine as
to the result, even if I accomplished this object,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
I had been in the habit of employing
myself very diligently for trifling profits, and
those who are in easy circumstances cannot
form an adequate idea of the lively satisfaction
I felt, when I could procure any work
by which I could earn a few shillings. This
kind of enjoyment, which Providence has
given to the poor, appears intended to soften
the many difficulties in their situation.</p>

<p>I was sensible, that, in printing my manuscript,
I had various obstacles to encounter.
It was difficult to procure proper materials
for the work in my sequestered abode. I felt
that my ignorance of the world, and little
acquaintance with business, would put me in
the power of every printer to whom I might
apply. I, however, resumed my compilation
on an enlarged scale, which included a few
of the reasons which the various denominations
give in defence of their different religious
systems. Stimulated by an ardent
curiosity, I entered into the vast field of
religious controversy, for which my early
reading had ill prepared me. I perused all
the controversial works I could possibly obtain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
with the utmost attention, in order to abridge
what appeared to me the most plausible arguments
for every denomination. As I read
controversy with a mind naturally wanting
in firmness and decision, and without that
pertinacity which blunts the force of arguments
which are opposed to the tenets we
have once imbibed, I suffered extremely from
mental indecision, while perusing the various
and contradictory arguments adduced by men
of piety and learning in defence of their respective
religious systems. Sometimes my
mind was so strongly excited, that extreme
feeling obliged me for a time to lay aside my
employment. Notwithstanding it required
much reading to perform my task, the painful
feelings I suffered while preparing my
work for the press far outweighed all the
other labor. Reading much religious controversy
must be extremely trying to a female,
whose mind, instead of being strengthened
by those studies which exercise the judgment,
and give stability to the character, is
debilitated by reading romances and novels,
which are addressed to the fancy and imagination,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
and are calculated to heighten the
feelings.</p>

<p>After my View of Religions was prepared
for the press, the difficulty still remained
of finding any printer willing and able to
print it without money immediately paid.
But at length, after various perplexities, this
compilation was put to the press in 1784.
The profit to myself was very small; for, as
it might well have been expected from my
father’s inexperience in the business of book
making, he was completely duped by the
printer, in making the bargain. After being
at the trouble of procuring upwards of four
hundred subscribers, all the compensation I
was able to obtain, was only fifty books; and
I was obliged to find a sale for them, after
the printer, (whose name, out of respect to
his descendants, I omit to mention,) had received
all the subscription money. As my
books sold very well, the printer must have
made something handsome by the publication.</p>

<p>The effect of reading so much religious
controversy, which had been very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
trying to my mind, was extremely prejudicial
to my health, and introduced a train of the
most painful nervous complaints. I was at
length brought so low, that the physician who
attended me supposed I was in a decline.
But after a tedious interval of extreme suffering,
I began gradually to recover; and afterwards
found my complaints were increased,
by following the injudicious advice of the
physician who attended me. To the skill
and attention of my friend Dr Mann, formerly
of Wrentham, I owe, under Heaven, the
preservation of my life at this period.</p>

<p>Soon after I began to recover, I received a
letter from the printer of my View of Religions,
informing me that he had sold the
greatest part of the edition, and was about
to reprint it; and requesting me to inform him
if I wished to make any additions to my
work. As I had the precaution to secure the
copy-right, agreeably to the law passed in
Massachusetts, 1783, I returned a laconic
answer, forbidding him to reprint it; and
he finally relinquished the design.</p>

<p>The information, that the first edition of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
my View of Religions was sold, gave me the
idea of reprinting it for my own benefit.
But as I was entirely destitute of pecuniary
resources, ignorant of the world, incapable of
conducting business, and precluded from almost
all intercourse with persons of literature
and information, and consequently destitute
of friends who were able and willing to assist
me, the execution of the plan was extremely
difficult. Even the few friends I
had gained at that time supposed the disadvantages
in my situation too great to encourage
my undertaking. Instead of assisting
me, they considered my plan as chimerical,
and depressed my hopes and discouraged my
exertions.</p>

<p>While I was struggling with embarrassments
and difficulties, I was involved in the
deepest affliction by the death of the beloved
sister, whom I mentioned in the preceding
Chapter. I then experienced the keenest
anguish the human heart can feel in losing
a friend.</p>

<p>To describe the excess of my grief on this
occasion would be altogether impossible.
Those, only, who have formed the highest
ideas of friendship, and have considered their
earthly happiness as dependent upon the life
of one beloved object, on whose judgment
they relied, and in whom they found comfort
and support in every difficulty and affliction,
can form an adequate idea of what
I felt on this occasion; which led me to exclaim,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And is she dead! My life, my all is gone.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The world’s a desert. Nothing now on earth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Can yield me joy, or comfort.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The death of my beloved sister made me
feel almost alone in the world. Our joys
and sorrows, and all our interests were so
closely blended, that I nearly identified her
existence with my own. Everything appeared
gloomy in my situation. My health
was feeble; I was entirely destitute of property;
my father’s circumstances were very
low; and I had no other relation or friend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
from whom I might expect to derive assistance.
But notwithstanding all the difficulties
in my situation, I determined to use every
possible exertion to help myself; considering
that, if I was unsuccessful in attempting to
extricate myself from poverty, my efforts
would awaken the activity of my mind, and
preserve me from sinking under the weight
of affliction I sustained in losing the best of
sisters. It was, perhaps, a happy circumstance,
that necessity stimulated me to exertion
in this most gloomy period of my existence.</p>

<p>After I began to prepare the additions to
my View of Religions, I found it required a
great effort to detach my mind from the recollection
of past sufferings, and force myself
to that mental exertion which is naturally
so congenial to my mind. At length,
however, I completed the task of preparing
my work for the press. I had previously,
in 1790, sent a petition to Congress, which
was presented by the late Fisher Ames,
<abbr title="esquire">Esq.</abbr> for a general law to be passed, to
secure to authors the copy-right of their publications.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
I now applied to a large number
of printers to know on what terms they
would publish my work. But, though I
wrote nearly the same letter to all, consisting
of a few direct questions, their answers
were generally various, prolix, and ambiguous.</p>

<p>I at length concluded to accept the terms
of one of the printers to whom I applied,
who offered me one hundred dollars in books,
for an edition of one thousand copies. When
I went to Boston for this purpose, a friend
of mine introduced me to the <abbr title="reverend.">Rev.</abbr> <abbr title="mister">Mr</abbr> Freeman,
whom I had only once before seen:
but I was well apprised of his benevolent
character, which I found more than realized
the ideas which I had formed of it from report.
I shall ever recollect the generous interest
he took in my affairs, with the most
lively gratitude. He removed my perplexity,
by transacting the business with the
printer. By his advice, a subscription paper
was published; and I soon found the benefit
of his patronage, in procuring a large
number of subscribers, and concluding an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
advantageous bargain for me with <abbr title="mister">Mr</abbr> Folsom,
the printer. The second edition was
published in 1791; and the emolument I derived
from it not only placed me in a comfortable
situation, but enabled me to pay the
debts I had contracted during mine and my
sister’s illness, and to put out a small sum
upon interest.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>


<p>Encouraged and animated by this success,
I soon formed the design of engaging
in another publication, and set myself to
choose a subject. It was poverty, not ambition,
or vanity, that first induced me to
become an author, or rather a compiler. But
I now formed the flattering idea, that I might
not only help myself, but benefit the public.
With this view, I engaged in writing a Summary
History of New England. I selected
this subject, rather for public utility, than for
my own gratification. My object was to
render my compilation useful to those in
early life, who had not time or opportunity
to peruse the large mass of materials, which,
previously to my compilation, lay scattered
in many publications. I knew the work
would require much reading upon dry subjects,
such as ancient news prints, state papers,
&amp;c. But I wrote for a bare subsistence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
and never wished to gain anything
from the public which I had not at least
earned by laborious investigation. I also
considered, that attention to such an antipoetical
subject would have a tendency to keep
my mind in a more healthy state, than the perusal
of works which are calculated to excite
the feelings. I therefore resolved to fix my
attention by investigating simple facts, and
by relinquishing to a great extent the reading
works of taste and imagination.</p>

<p>When I compiled this work, there was not
any history of New England extant, except
Mather’s Magnalia, and Neale’s History;
and these extended only to an early period in
the annals of our country. If there had been
only one work, which reached to the acceptance
of the Federal constitution, my task
had been far less laborious. There was no
authentic account of Rhode Island, except
that of Callender’s. This induced me to
spend some time in Providence, in order to
examine the Records in the Secretary’s office.
The perusal of old manuscripts, which were
damaged by time, was painful to my eyes;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
but as they were naturally strong, I did not
for some time perceive the injury I suffered
from the task.</p>

<p>After I returned from Providence, I attended
to my compilation with unremitting diligence,
and hoped not only to obtain a temporary
support, but to make a small provision
for future subsistence. Stimulated by
these sanguine views, I wrote early and late
during one winter, and expected to put my
work to the press the ensuing spring. But
how vain were all these pleasing anticipations!
A new misfortune arrested my progress,
and made me feel my entire dependence
upon divine Providence. I found my
sight suddenly fail to that degree, that I was
obliged to lay aside reading, writing, and every
employment which required the use of my
eyes. In this distressed situation, I consulted
a number of physicians; and their prescriptions
rather increased, than diminished my
complaints. The gloomy apprehension of
being totally deprived of my sight was distressing
beyond description. I not only
anticipated the misfortune of being obliged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
forever to relinquish those literary pursuits
which had constituted so much of my enjoyment
during life, and was at this time my
only resource for a subsistence, but as I had
from my earliest years been an enthusiastic
admirer of the beauties of nature, I felt the
most painful sensation in reflecting that the
time might arrive, when</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">‘With the year</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Seasons return, but not to me return</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Day, or the sweet approach of eve or morn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or sight of vernal bloom, or summer rose.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At length, by the advice of a respectable
friend, I applied to Dr Jeffries; and by assiduously
following his prescriptions for about
two years, I partially recovered my sight.
For the encouragement of those who are
troubled with similar complaints, I would
mention, that when I first consulted the doctor,
he had not any expectation my eyes would
recover so as to enable me to make the use
of them I have since done. But by applying
laudanum and sea water several times in
the course of the day, for two years, I recovered
so far as to resume my studies; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
by employing an amanuensis to assist me in
transcribing my manuscript, I was enabled to
print the work in 1799. Previously to putting
the copy to the press, I consulted all the
living authors, and showed them the use I
had made of their works in my compilation,
and they did not make any objection. As
my eyes were still weak, I could not bestow
the same attention in condensing the last
part of my History, as the first; and consequently
the History of the American Revolution
was much more prolix than I originally
intended. In giving an account of the war,
my ignorance of military terms rendered it
necessary to transcribe more from Dr Ramsay’s
History, than I had done in any other
part of the work. I therefore wrote an apology
to the doctor, and had the satisfaction of
receiving in return a very interesting letter
from Mrs Ramsay, expressing her approbation
of my work, and inclosing a bill of ten
dollars. Before my eyes failed, I had sent
out a subscription paper; but afterward, the
idea that I never should be able to complete
the compilation, induced me to drop it; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
I was obliged to publish the work almost
entirely at my own expense. The printers
were in low circumstances, and required payment
before I could dispose of the books.
I was therefore obliged to borrow a sum of
money to defray the expenses of the work,
which, as it was printed on very good paper,
were large, and I derived but little profit
from my labor.</p>

<p>My next publication was the third edition
of my View of Religions, to which I made
the addition of a hundred pages. The
<abbr title="reverend.">Rev.</abbr> <abbr title="mister">Mr</abbr> Freeman, who continued his kind
attentions, made the bargain for me with the
printer, by which I was entitled to receive
five hundred dollars in yearly payments, for
an edition of two thousand copies. This
relieved me from the embarrassments in
which I was involved by printing my History
of New England at my own expense. As
my eyes still continued too weak to engage
in any new laborious work, I determined to
wait till a large part of my History of New
England was sold; and then, if my life continued,
to abridge it for the use of schools.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>In the meantime, however, I set about
writing a concise View of the Christian Religion,
selected from the writings of eminent
laymen. I wrote with difficulty, as my eyes
were still very weak; but I wished to exert
myself as much as possible to be useful, and to
gain a subsistence. Though attention to religious
controversy had led me to feel undecided
on some disputed points, of which perhaps
Christians of equal piety form different opinions,
my conviction of the truth of divine revelation,
instead of being weakened by all my
researches, was strengthened and confirmed;
and I wished to make a public declaration of
my sentiments on this important subject. I
found it difficult to procure proper materials
for the work, as I was utterly unable to purchase
books. A considerable part of this
compilation, as well as the additions to the
third edition of my View of Religions, was
written in booksellers’ shops. I went to
make visits in Boston, in order to consult
books in this way, which it was impossible
for me to buy, or borrow. I desire, however,
to recognise with gratitude the attention of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
my kind father, who took pains that I should
have the benefit of all books which he could
procure, and assisted me greatly in disposing
of my works. When I had completed my
compilation, I found the printers and booksellers
unwilling to purchase the copy, because
much had been written on the subject,
and these publications were unsaleable. At
length, in 1804, I agreed with a printer to execute
the work, upon the small consideration
of receiving only one hundred dollars in
books.</p>

<p>The tenor of my life at this time was very
monotonous. It was enlivened, however, by
gleams of happiness, from the society of a
few friends, and the pleasure I derived from
literary pursuits; and, by my convictions of
the truth of that religion, to the examination
of which I had devoted so much of my time.
My eyes still continued very weak, and I
wrote under the apprehension of being reduced
to a state that would preclude all application
to study. A considerable part of my History
of New England being now disposed of,
my only resource appeared to be to abridge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
that work for the use of schools. The profit
I hoped to derive from this compilation
seemed to me to constitute all I had to depend
upon in future, if my life should be
spared. While I entertained these hopes, in
which I was made sanguine by my knowledge
of the success with which books for
schools had been printed, can it be a subject
of blame, or reproach, to a person in my
situation, that I felt extremely grieved, and
hurt, when I found my design anticipated by
a reverend gentleman, whose calling, and indefatigable
industry, are highly respectable?
The difference between us was left to referees,
who sustained a high reputation for
ability, and sound judgment, extensive information,
and moral excellence. I was satisfied
with their decision. But I was reduced
to the painful task of writing on the subject;
for, though I took this measure with extreme
reluctance, my opponent left me no other
alternative. I sincerely hope the painful
affair may never be recalled to his prejudice.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>


<p>Notwithstanding the little profit, and various
discouragements I had experienced in
writing for the press, as I was entirely dependent
upon my own exertions for a support,
I was resolved to persevere. I had
now acquired a number of valuable friends,
to whose generous exertions in my favor I
was deeply indebted. By several of them,
I was enabled to put my abridgment of the
History of New England to the press. I was
however unfortunate in this, as well as my
other compilations. The printer failed while
it was in the press, which deprived me of
the profit I expected to derive from it. Two
years afterwards, I published a new edition.
A similar misfortune befel me in this second
attempt to avail myself of my labors.</p>

<p>But though my productions were far from
being profitable, and I had frequent interruptions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
in my studies from ill health, and
bad eyes, I still had my share of enjoyment.
I hoped my works might be useful, and I
was highly gratified by their candid reception
by the public.</p>

<p>I next chose a subject in which I thought
it probable that I should not meet with any
interference. I formed the design of writing
the History of the Jews, though I was
sensible that it would require much reading,
and that I must wander through a dreary
wilderness, unenlivened by one spot of verdure.
My curiosity was strongly excited,
and I determined to persevere in my attempt
to investigate the fate of this wonderful
people. I began the introduction
with their state under the Persian monarchy,
after their restoration from the Babylonish
captivity. The standard works for
this History were Josephus, and Basnage,
the latter of whom brings his narrative down
only to the 19th century. After this period,
I was obliged to compile from desultory
publications and manuscripts. I had at this
time the privilege of corresponding with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
celebrated Gregoire, who had attained
great celebrity for the conspicuous part he
acted during the French Revolution, and exerted
all his energy in the first constitutional
assembly to procure the rights of citizens
for the Jews. He had the goodness
to send me some writings in their favor,
which increased the interest I felt in this
oppressed people.</p>

<p>Previously to concluding this gloomy detail
of the difficulties I encountered, while writing
for the press, I would first notice, that
I was obliged to exert myself to the utmost
to overcome my natural timidity, and accommodate
myself to my situation. After
the age and infirmities of my father prevented
him from assisting me, as he had
formerly done, in selling and exchanging
the copies of my work, I was necessitated to
exert myself in doing business out of the
female line, which exposed me to public
notice. And as I could not but be sensible
that my manners were remarkably awkward,
this consciousness, joined with my ignorance
of the established rules of propriety,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
rendered me tremblingly apprehensive
of exposing myself to ridicule. These unpleasant
feelings, however, in time abated.
In order to meet this trial, I considered,
that what is right and necessary in the situation
in which Providence has placed me,
cannot be really improper; and though my
acting upon this principle may have exposed
me to the censure, or ridicule of those, whose
ideas upon the subject are derived from the
varying modes of fashion, and not from the
unchanging laws of moral rectitude, it saved
me from a feeling which would have been
infinitely more painful, that of self-reproach.
My objects were, to obtain the approbation
of my own heart, and the esteem of a few
friends whose opinion I most highly prized,
and I was comparatively indifferent to the
censure or ridicule of the world in general.</p>

<p>In the life of Mrs Charlotte Smith it is
pertly remarked, that the ‘penalties and
discouragements attending authors in general
fall upon woman with double weight.
To the curiosity of the idle, and the envy
of the malicious, their sex affords a peculiar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
excitement. Arraigned not merely as
writers, but as women, their characters, their
conduct, and even their personal endowments,
become the object of severe inquisition.
From the common allowances claimed
by the species, literary women appear only
to be exempted.’</p>

<p>Though I have been too insignificant, and
treated with too much candor, fully to realize
the above remarks, yet I have been in
a situation deeply to feel the trials which attend
literary pursuits. At length I saw old
age approaching, without any provision for
it, when if my life was spared, I should be
incapable of exerting myself; and my mind
was at times depressed by this gloomy prospect.</p>

<p>While I was compiling my History of the
Jews, I boarded in Dedham. I was here
honored with the friendship, and received
the kind offices of <abbr title="mister">Mr</abbr> Dowse, his lady, and
her sister,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and more pecuniary favors than I
have ever experienced from any other individuals.
Whenever I visited this happy
family, I was received with the utmost cordiality;
and I desire publicly to express my
grateful sense of their goodness.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> <i>Mrs Shaw</i>, who allowed Miss Adams one hundred dollars

</div>

<p>While writing my History, my eyes, which,
since I had first injured them, have been
occasionally troublesome, failed to that degree,
that I was induced again to go to Boston
to consult Dr Jeffries, in the hope, that, by
attending to his directions, I might finish my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
work. During this visit at Boston, I received
the unexpected intelligence, that a number
of benevolent gentlemen had settled an
annuity upon me, to relieve me from the
embarrassments I had hitherto suffered.
The Hon. Josiah Quincy, Stephen Higginson,
<abbr title="esquire">Esq.</abbr> and William Shaw, <abbr title="esquire">Esq.</abbr> were some
of its first promoters. This providential
interference excited my most lively gratitude
to my generous benefactors, and I hope I
sensibly felt my deep obligation to the source
of all good.</p>

<p>My generous friends could hardly appreciate
the extent of the benefit they conferred
upon me. I had not been able to make any
provision for my declining years, and had not
a place on earth which I could call my home.
My spirits were depressed by my destitute
circumstances, and I am persuaded that under
Providence, the generosity of my friends
was the means of prolonging my life.</p>

<p>I had now attained a condition more eligible
than my most sanguine wishes could ever
have led me to anticipate. If in early life
I could have enjoyed the literary advantages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
I now possessed, I should have thought it
the height of earthly happiness. But I was
now too far advanced in life to profit by the
advantages I had gained. However, I was
grateful, and happy. My friend William
Shaw, <abbr title="esquire">Esq.</abbr> gave me the liberty of frequenting
the Atheneum. Amidst that large and
valuable collection of books, I found an inexhaustible
source of information and entertainment;
and among other advantages, I
found a few literary friends, in whose conversation
I enjoyed ‘the feast of reason and
the flow of soul.’ Among the many blessings
I was favored with, I shall ever highly
appreciate the acquaintance and friendship of
the late <abbr title="reverend.">Rev.</abbr> <abbr title="mister">Mr</abbr> Buckminster, in whom I
contemplated with admiration the rare union
of intellectual, moral, and religious excellence;
of a powerful mind with extensive information,
and a feeling heart enlivened by devotion.
He was admired for his distinguished
abilities and learning by all who knew him;
but the peculiar traits of benevolence, nobleness
of mind, sincerity and sweetness of
temper, which adorned his character, could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
only be duly appreciated by those who were
honored with his friendship.</p>

<p><abbr title="mister">Mr</abbr> Buckminster was so kind as to give
me the use of his large and valuable library,
which was of great advantage to me in compiling
my History of the Jews. In my efforts
to complete the work, I was encouraged
and animated by his participating in the
interest I felt in this extraordinary people.
Though entering into the details of the sufferings
of the persecuted Jewish Nation, yet
the enthusiasm <abbr title="mister">Mr</abbr> Buckminster inspired,
and the pleasure of conversing with him
upon a subject with which he was intimately
acquainted, rendered the time I was writing
my History one of the happiest periods of
my life. I completed my work in 1812, a
few months before his death.</p>

<p>In the year 1812 I sustained a severe affliction,
by the sudden death of <abbr title="mister">Mr</abbr> Buckminster.
Amidst the large number who
lamented his death, I believe there was none
(except his near relations) who felt more distressed
than myself. I desire, however, to be
grateful to divine Providence for the privilege
of his acquaintance and friendship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>While my feelings were deeply susceptible
from the recent wound they had received
by the death of <abbr title="mister">Mr</abbr> Buckminster, I went to
Medfield to visit my aged father, with the
hope that I might do something to administer
to his comfort, and in this way soothe my
own grief. But while I was with him, he
was seized with a complaint which put a
period to his life. Though from his age,
and infirmities, I had been often led to anticipate
this event, I found it very trying
when I actually realized it. He had been a
very kind parent to me, and though he could
not bestow any property upon me, he was
very solicitous to aid me as far as he could.
He was a great assistant to me both in procuring
books, and in disposing of my works.
During the last years of his life, he was assiduously
engaged in studying the sacred
Scriptures, with the assistance of all the
commentaries he could procure. In the funeral
sermon preached upon his death, the <abbr title="reverend.">Rev.</abbr>
Dr Prentiss observes, ‘He was ever strongly
attached to the society of literary and serious
people, particularly of the clergy, with
a number of whom he kept up a friendly intercourse.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
There is reason to believe, that
by his exertions for many years he contributed
in no small degree to the diffusion of
knowledge and piety, and to the advancement
of the cause of Christ.’ My father’s
love of books continued till the last. He
read, and heard reading, on the day on which
he expired. My residence in Boston enabled
me to procure books for his perusal,
and it afforded me great pleasure to be thus
permitted to gratify my honored parent.</p>

<p>When, after the death of my father, I
returned to Boston, my mind was depressed
with my recent losses. But I was sensible
that I was still favored with many inestimable
privileges. <abbr title="mister">Mr</abbr> Buckminster had been
so kind as to introduce me to a number of
his acquaintances, who treated me with that
genuine kindness which is the essence of
true politeness.</p>

<p>Among the number of those excellent
friends, to whom <abbr title="mister">Mr</abbr> Buckminster was so
kind as to introduce me, I would particularly
recognise Mrs Dearborn, and Mrs Winthrop,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
who shone in the circles of polished
life, and adorned their eminent stations by
their engaging manners, and highly cultivated
minds; and still more, by their christian
virtues. They were blessings to those
around them; and for a course of years favored
me with their attention, and kind offices.
When they were removed by death to a
higher state of existence, I deeply mourned
the heavy and irreparable loss I sustained.</p>

<p>While deeply indebted to the bounty of
my dear and honored friends, I wished to
pursue my literary occupations with as much
diligence as my health would permit. But in
the decline of life, I was so far debilitated by
repeated fevers, at small intervals from each
other, that I was unable to write for the
press. At length, I so far recovered, as to
resume a work I had formerly begun, upon
the New Testament, which I designed to be
much larger than it is; but my advanced age
induced me only to publish a little book, entitled,
‘Letters on the Gospels,’ which has
passed through two editions.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned the perplexity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
and embarrassment of my mind, while writing
my View of Religions. After removing
to Boston, and residing in that city while
the disputes upon Unitarian sentiments
were warmly agitated, I read all that came
in my way upon both sides of the question;
and carefully examined the New Testament,
with, I think, a sincere and ardent desire to
know the truth. I deeply felt the difficulties
upon both sides of the question; yet
prevailingly give the preference to that class
of Unitarians, who adopt the highest idea of
the greatness and dignity of the Son of God.
I never arrived to that degree of decision
that some have attained on that subject.
In this, and every other disputable subject,
I would adopt the following lines;</p>

<p>Those who have been favored with a
personal knowledge of the Author of the
short Memoir contained in this book, will
read it with the deepest interest; and perhaps
to them it may seem almost superfluous
to say more of her. But Miss Adams’s
works have circulated far beyond the sphere
in which she moved, and there are many
who are desirous of knowing her, as she was
appreciated by others, and not by her own
estimate. Such would be poorly satisfied
with the short sketch she has given of herself,
though her friends must ever value it as
a parting legacy.</p>

<p>The ‘timidity of early years’ followed
Miss Adams through life; and, even when
surrounded by intimate friends, it never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
wholly forsook her. It was a sensitiveness
that sprung from deep feeling, and a diffidence
that was the result of genuine humility.
This often operated unfavorably
upon her manners, and produced an awkwardness,
of which she was painfully conscious.
But there were times when the warmth of
her heart, and the cultivation of her mind,
gave an enthusiasm and eloquence to her
language, that astonished those who listened
to her. At such times, her countenance lost
its usual calm placidity, and glowed with an
animation that rendered it highly interesting.
There was indeed a wonderful singularity in
her appearance. In the circles of polished
life to which she was often courted, there
was nothing like her. In the circles of humble
life, she was equally unassuming, and
equally peculiar. No one could see her,
without feeling that she was not of this
world. It is possible that part of this timidity
might have arisen from the seclusion of
early years. But it is certain, that no culture,
or discipline, could have formed her manners
to the standard of easy and fashionable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
life. She sometimes observed, ‘I know I
am very awkward; I never could learn to
make a curtsey.’ But it must not be supposed
that there was in her any want of gentleness,
or propriety. Her disinterested and
affectionate disposition made her, in reality,
all that the most calculating would desire to
appear.</p>

<p>The simplicity, and often the abstractedness
of Miss Adams’ manner, led many to suppose
that her talents were confined to the subjects
on which she wrote. Some considered
her as a walking dictionary of ‘Religious
Opinions.’ Others viewed her merely as an
‘Abridgment of the History of New England.’
And many said, ‘if you want to
know Miss Adams, you must talk to her
about the Jews.’ And this last was, indeed,
a subject that always called forth the energy
of her mind. She had faithfully studied
their history, and she venerated the antiquity
of their origin. Her inquiring mind was
deeply interested by their ‘wonderful destination,
peculiar habits, and religious rites.’
She felt for them as a suffering and persecuted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
people; and she felt yet more, when she
considered them as a standing monument of
that religion, which she regarded as the
first and best of God’s gifts to men. It was
the long contemplation of this chosen race
that induced her, amidst all the obstacles
that were in her way, to write their history.
It was an arduous labor. Yet her work is
a proof, that, in this ‘barren wilderness she
found many a spot of verdure.’ But those
who viewed her merely in relation to her
literary works, knew her but imperfectly.
With her extreme simplicity, there was an
uncommon depth of observation, and an intuitive
knowledge of character. She was
often in circles where her timidity kept her
almost wholly silent, and where she hardly
seemed to be even a spectator. But her
subsequent remarks would show how accurately
she had observed, and how nicely she
had discriminated. In speaking of a lady
of her acquaintance, she said, ‘I value and
admire her, but I can never be easy with her.
She is <em>so</em> kind, and <em>so</em> condescending, that I
can see she never forgets I am a poor awkward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
old woman.’ At another time, when
deploring the loss of a young lady, whose
fine talents had made her the delight of her
friends, ‘and yet,’ she said, ‘she died at the
best time. Her powers were brilliant, and
beautiful, but they were exhausting to herself;
and had she lived, she would have
faded before she reached her prime.’ Her
mind was habitually cheerful, and her cheerfulness
was much increased by her sensibility
to the works of nature. She looked upon
every object with the eye of a poet, and
forgot her infirmities, and even her diffidence,
as she described her emotions. On visiting
her sister, who resided in the country, after
having been confined to her chamber, in the
city through the winter, ‘it seemed to me,’
said she, ‘as if the world was just created.’
No one could exclaim with more feeling and
truth,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘I care not, fortune, what you me deny,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You cannot rob me of free nature’s grace,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You cannot bar the windows of the sky,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through which Aurora shows her brightening face.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There is but little doubt, that, had she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
given way to the natural temperament of her
mind, which was enthusiastic and romantic,
she might have been a poet. But her duties,
and her lot, led her into a different path of
life. In her youth, however, she occasionally
listened to the inspiration of the muses;
and though she never set any value on these
productions, they discover much excellent
thought, and a high tone of feeling.</p>

<p>The want of early advantages, to which
Miss Adams so feelingly alludes in her memoirs,
ought not to be forgotten, nor the
difficulties through which she struggled.
Her attendance upon any school was extremely
uncertain, and often interrupted by
her feeble health. Added to this, the schools
of a country village are not often of the
highest class. Even the elementary parts
of education are much neglected in them.
‘I never,’ said she, ‘was taught how to hold
my pen.’</p>

<p>There is nothing that more strikingly denotes
the progress of literature in this part
of the country, than the attention which is
at present paid to female education. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
are few branches, if any, in which boys are
instructed, which are not now equally open
to girls. Not many years ago, however, the
test of a good school rested principally upon
the exhibitions made of hand-writing, spelling,
and arithmetic. Grammar, it is true,
was professedly taught, but in a manner that
conveyed few ideas to the pupil. To get
the longest lessons, and to be at the head of
the class, constituted the best scholar. By
degrees, parsing, in its simplest forms, was
introduced, to aid the knowledge of grammar.
Composition, geography and history
followed; and the education of girls began
to assume a more respectable standing. Yet
even at this period, our village school-master
much resembled Goldsmith’s, of whom,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘The village all declared how much he knew;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twas certain he could write and cipher too.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was at such schools as these that Miss
Adams received her early education. Her ardent
thirst for knowledge, however, and her
industry and perseverance enabled her, in maturer
life, to make uncommon acquirements.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
Yet she always felt, and regretted, the
want of more thorough, and systematic instruction.
Her father entered into trade
as a desperate resource from the weariness
of an agricultural life, for which he had no
taste. He was plundered, and cheated by the
man, whom he engaged to carry on his farm;
and as he had plunged into all the transactions
of a country trader, dealing in books
and drugs, English and West India goods,
through all came vexation and disappointment,
and a total failure ensued. A large
proportion of his books were left on his
hands, and afforded to Miss Adams great facilities
for reading. Her father, too, happily
for her, had encouraged in her a taste congenial
to his own; and her mind became cultivated,
and embued with knowledge, almost
without her own consciousness of the
progress she was making. However unpropitious
to her were the pecuniary disappointments
of her father’s life, they seem to
have exerted a favorable influence on her
mind. Resort was had also, at this time, to the
receiving of several boarders into the family;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
and from these she acquired the knowledge
of Greek and Latin. Of this knowledge, she
tells us she availed herself, for fitting three
young men for College; and for <abbr title="mister">Mr</abbr> P.
Clark, one of her pupils, mentioned in her
memoirs, she retained through life the warmest
regard. He married a friend of hers;
and ‘this,’ said she, ‘was the only match I
ever had any hand in making.’ Of her
mother, she always spoke with enthusiastic
reverence; and though only eleven years of
age when she died, she retained a perfect recollection
of her. Mrs Adams was married
at fifteen, and died at the age of thirty
three, leaving three girls and two boys.
Her short life seems to have been filled with
usefulness; and the following epitaph, written
by an Episcopal clergyman, who was a
particular friend, and constant visitor of the
family, may still be traced on her humble
grave stone, should any descendant of ‘Old
Mortality’ chance to wander to the spot.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Beneath this monument of love and truth,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Such was the woman! could the saint be more?’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>After the death of her mother, the care of
Hannah, and of a younger sister, devolved
on Elizabeth, who was the oldest daughter.
They now lived in great retirement; and
one of Miss Adams’s early employments was,
weaving lace with bobbins on a cushion. In
referring to this, she afterwards pleasantly
observed, that, ‘it was much more profitable
than writing books.’ This manner of life,
with her desultory habits of reading, gave a
romantic and enthusiastic turn to her mind,
which was never essentially changed either
by time or circumstances.</p>

<p>Miss Adams’s heart was however peculiarly
alive to the ties of natural affection. She
deeply felt the death of an aunt, who had
shown for her maternal tenderness. But as
long as her sister Elizabeth lived, she had, to
use her own words, a friend, a counsellor, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
guide. ‘There was,’ she said, ‘but one heart
between us; and I used sometimes to tell
my sister, in the overflowing of my affection,
that I could bear to lose everything if she
was spared to me; but, if she were taken
away, I should surely die!’ Yet this calamitous
event took place; and Miss Adams lived
to prove, as many others have done, that
there is, in the day of sorrow, a strength
imparted beyond human fortitude. The
health of this beloved sister was declining
for nearly two years; and it was, during that
time, one of her constant objects, to fortify
Miss Adams’s mind for an event, that she felt
was near, and which she feared would be overwhelming.
It however gradually approached,
and brought no terrors to herself. She
was calm, and resigned; constantly expressing
her ‘entire submission to the Divine will,
and laying all her burden at the foot of the
cross.’ There were no enthusiastic flights,
nor was there any unnatural exaltation of
mind in her views of death. Though in the
bloom of youth and with an ardent enjoyment
of life, she met the event like a Christian.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
Hers was a philosophy which was
formed and nurtured by religion.</p>

<p>‘For years after my sister’s death,’ said Miss
Adams, ‘it was a struggle to live.’ Her health
was extremely feeble, her heart she believed
broken, and poverty pressed heavily upon
her. There were times, indeed, when she
felt as if she had not even a home. Her
father had made over his house and property
to a son, with whom he and his other children
continued to live; but as this son was
married, and his family was increasing, notwithstanding
his paternal kindness, Miss
Adams felt, and could not but feel, as if she
was a burden upon her brother. This was
the most trying period of her life, and it was
always recollected by her with strong emotion.</p>

<p>The first effort of her pen, after her sister’s
death, produced some lines on that
subject. They seem to be the very breathings
of her heart, and are thrown together
almost without form; yet a few extracts
from them will best show the state of her
mind.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Avert thy fate,—sister, thou still hadst lived.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Many expressions of her deep feeling on
this subject might be extracted from her papers;
and to her immediate friends, they are
precious records of a sorrow stricken, and
resigned spirit. But the friendship of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
two sisters was such as ‘strangers intermeddle
not with.’ The death of this sister
seemed to be the dissolution of a tie, like
that which occasioned the exclamation of
David in his beautiful lamentation over Jonathan,
‘Thy love to me was wonderful,
passing the love of women.’</p>

<p>That Miss Adams drew her support from
religion under this calamity, her manuscripts
very clearly show. She employed herself,
when unable to compose, in making extracts
from the Scriptures, which she applied to her
particular state of mind. These she arranged
in a little book, and preserved till her
death.</p>

<p>In her memoirs, she alludes to a small
circle of females that had gradually been
drawn together from the neighboring towns,
by a similarity of taste and situation; and
in this circle she found great enjoyment. In
after years, her imagination probably exaggerated
their merit. Yet she retained many
proofs that they were not of an ordinary stamp.
In speaking of this knot of friends, Miss
Adams, said, ‘they were all poor, and most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
of them good-looking,’ and then added, with
her usual simplicity, ‘I had the fewest attractions
of any of them.’</p>

<p>Nor was Miss Adams’s pen at this time
idle. The powers of her mind were early
appreciated by her young associates; or,
perhaps, it is more just to say, that they obtained
that influence, which, however unclaimed,
is stamped upon superior intellect.
Mind is created to rule. Wealth, and all merely
outward distinctions are thrown into obscurity,
when brought in competition with
mental power. This is strikingly exemplified
in public and professional strife; and,
though more minutely, yet hardly less obviously,
in the miniature circle of private
life. Miss Adams, with all her humility,
and her retiring modesty, was the <i>casuist</i> of
her youthful friends. A number of her papers
that remain, prove how often she was
resorted to by her companions in cases of
opinion; and the publication of a few of
these, it is believed, cannot be wholly uninteresting
to those who knew her in later life.</p>

<p>One of her young friends put to her this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
interrogative. Ought mankind to be respected
for their personal worth alone, abstracted
from all accidental causes?</p>

<p>To this question Miss Adams replied.</p>

<p>‘Mankind ought primarily to be respected
for their personal worth; yet if accidental
causes make that worth appear more conspicuous,
it may increase our esteem, which
still is founded on personal worth in proportion
as it appears. The more we see of
virtue, the more it ought to attract our love
and admiration. Virtue becomes visible only
by its effects. The diamond we value for
its intrinsic worth. But when it is polished
and set, its essential beauty appears more
refulgent. So external accomplishments,
and accidental causes, set forth the original
beauty of virtue, and serve to heighten its
charms. There are particular circumstances
in which every virtue will shine with peculiar
lustre. For instance, humility has intrinsic
excellence. But it appears most
attractive in those who are placed in affluent
circumstances, and are surrounded by pomp
and splendor. Fortitude, also, is an excellent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
quality of the mind. But suffering and
adversity must bring it forth. Persons who
have performed eminent services for their
country are worthy of greater honor, than
those who have remained in private life
with equal worth. I conclude, therefore,
that mankind ought to be esteemed for their
personal worth, as it is rendered conspicuous
by accidental causes.’</p>

<p>Another question proposed was, whether
virtue ought not to be regarded as its own
reward, without any reference to a future
state of happiness, or misery?</p>

<p>To this she replied, ‘A regularity of
conduct is for the interest of all, even were
their prospects terminated by the enjoyments
of this life. We cannot doubt that the virtuous
Seneca enjoyed more happiness than
Nero, his cruel and tyrannical master. So
far as inward peace of conscience depends
on virtue, it is its own reward. But we do
not find that its ends are commensurate with
its exertions. Honest industry does not
always bring even a moderate support. It
therefore appears evident to me, that there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
would not be sufficient reward for, nor consequently
sufficient excitement to, the sacrifices
which virtue requires, without the hope
of a future life. God, by the influences of
his spirit, brings home the truths of the
Gospel upon the mind, and makes them the
spring of new, and right principles. Hence
Divine Revelation informs us, “by his own
will begat he us by the word of truth.” If
we look for nothing beyond the grave, too
many will say, “what advantageth it me?”
Dr Doddridge observes, “there are some sufferings
of flesh and blood, to which good
men for conscience’ sake have been exposed,
so extreme, that without some extraordinary
support from God, it would be really impossible
that the pleasures of a rational thought
should be enjoyed by them.” Such support
must arise from a view of a future state, and
from a conviction that afflictions are but for
a moment, and are “working out for them a far
more exceeding, even an eternal weight of
glory.” Not that I mean to say, we are to
expect Heaven as a <em>reward</em> for our virtue,
independent of the free grace of God. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
he has promised a glorious inheritance to
those who do well, and this ought to stimulate
men to the greatest industry in his
service. Love to God is the great principle
of christian virtue.’</p>

<p>On another occasion she was applied to by
a friend, who was placed in an embarrassing
situation, for her sentiments on the subject
of forming a connexion, without mutual attachment.</p>

<p>The following observations are extracted
from her reply.</p>

<p>‘It has been readily allowed, that marriage,
without great congeniality, must render
a person of sensibility extremely wretched.
Novel writers have general urged the
impropriety of this connexion from this motive.
But as this life is only a passport to
a better, the principal objection ought to
arise from a nobler source.</p>

<p>‘Both religion and morality require that
there should be a conformity between our
words and actions; and, that in both we
should always be entirely true. Now when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
two people marry, they virtually and publicly
declare, that they prefer each other to all
the world. If that preference be wanting,
this declaration is a capital breach of sincerity.
It is the declaration of an untruth before
Heaven and earth.</p>

<p>‘The least deviation from truth, in this
one capital point, imposes a kind of necessity
to practise continual dissimulation.
Having exhibited to the world the strongest
proof of a peculiar, and individual affection,
honor and reputation render it of consequence
to keep up the deception. By doing
this, however, the delicacy of moral feeling
must be continually wearing away. And
what will be the happiness of married life
under circumstances like these?</p>

<p>‘The attention which a husband and wife
have a right to expect from each other, must
originate in a decided preference of each other;
else the indifference of one of the parties
may effectually destroy that happiness,
which they had bound themselves by the
most sacred obligations to promote.</p>

<p>‘But even this continual dissimulation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
which is highly injurious to the moral character,
and extremely painful to an ingenuous
mind, will be wholly unavailing for its
end. True love is of so delicate a nature,
that it can never be satisfied with anything
short of love in return; and it is of a power
so penetrating, that, by its own light, it
sees into the heart of the person beloved.
Its primary object is to possess the heart.
“Not the warmest expressions of affection,
or the most fervent protestations, are able to
give any satisfaction, where we are not persuaded
the affection is real, and the satisfaction
mutual.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“All these possessed are nought, but as they are</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The first edition of Miss Adams’s View of
Religion was published before her sister’s
death, and partly transcribed by this sister.
The second was begun as soon after this afflicting
event took place, as she could collect
resolution to engage in it. Those who
knew her might indeed wonder that any motive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
could at any time be powerful enough to
induce her to publish a book. Her humility,
her diffidence, and her total ignorance
of business, seemed to present insurmountable
obstacles. It was necessary,
however, that she should earn a subsistence
in some way. She had tried various methods.
Making lace, during the war, had been
one of the most lucrative employments.
But home-made lace could only be tolerated,
when no other could be procured; and as
soon as importation become easy, it sunk
into total disuse. Spinning, weaving, and
braiding straw were by turns tried. But all
afforded her only a scanty subsistence. Her
eyes were weak, and often so much inflamed
that she could not use them. Her general
health also was extremely feeble, and her
mind depressed by present evil, and harassed
by distressing fears for the future. ‘It
was desperation, therefore, and not vanity,’
said she, ‘that induced me to publish.’ Her
memoirs mention the disappointment she
experienced in the profits of her first edition.
When about publishing a second, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
was necessary to pay a few shillings for the
further security of the copy-right; and this
sum, though so small, she was obliged to
borrow from a friend. On the subject of
poverty, she always spoke with great feeling.
She had early in life been brought up
in indulgence; and poverty had come upon
her at an age, when the sensibility of the
heart are most alive. There can hardly, indeed,
be a suffering more acute to a feeling
mind, that has experienced the pleasure of
bestowing, than to find its means of benevolence
cut off, and all its powers necessarily
turned into a weary, wasting struggle for
self-preservation. ‘And yet,’ she said, ‘I had
then enjoyments, of which the rich have no
idea. When I had any work brought in that
would enable me to earn a few shillings, by
which I might buy paper, or any articles of
stationary, I engaged in writing with an
interest that beguiled the monotony of my
life.’ After the second edition of her book
was published, she kept a school for the summer
months for successive years; and,
though in this employment she experienced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
the usual difficulties of school-keeping in the
country, it was, upon the whole, a source of
happiness. As the schools were in the neighboring
towns, she resided among the parents
of the children by turns; and her intelligent
and acute mind often derived amusement,
and profit, from these occasional residences.
She treasured up many pleasant
little anecdotes, that marked the habits and
manners of the families in which she then
lived, many of which retained much of the
primitive simplicity of their forefathers.</p>

<p>One anecdote may not be unacceptable.
She passed several months in the family of a
respectable farmer, whose turn it was to
receive the <i>school-mistress</i>. His wife was a
pattern of frugal, industrious management;
yet not devoid of that desire of appearing
‘decent,’ which was manifested by the Vicar
of Wakefield’s wife before her. The usual
dress of females in the country at that
period, when engaged in domestic employments,
was the ‘short russet kyrtle,’ confined
at the waist by a home-spun checked
apron. This was the costume of the mistress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
of the family. The year Miss Adams
resided there had been one of uncommon
prosperity. The crops were abundant, and
many little luxuries had been added to the
household establishment. With injunctions
of secrecy, the good woman informed her
guest, that, if the next year also should prove
to be as prosperous, she intended to wear
<em>long calico gowns</em>!</p>

<p>Miss Adams remarked, that these early
scenes often recurred to her mind, amidst the
wealth and splendor she witnessed in later
life; and the impressions of both were
heightened by the contrast.</p>

<p>That her sensibility was a source of pain,
as well as of happiness, cannot be doubted.
She censured herself severely for moments
of irritation, and felt the keenest self-reproach
for what might be truly called the
infirmity of her nature. That she perfectly
understood her weaknesses, and moral
exposures, and guarded in her heart the avenues
to temptation, the following resolutions,
found among her papers, are a sufficient
proof.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>


<h3>SERIOUS RESOLUTIONS.</h3>

<p>I resolve to read the Bible more attentively,
and diligently, and to be constant and fervent
in prayer for divine illumination and
direction.</p>

<p>2d. To read less from curiosity, and a
desire to acquire worldly knowledge, and
more for the regulation of my heart and life;
consequently, to have my reading less desultory,
and to read more books of practical divinity.</p>

<p>3d. In choosing my friends and companions,
to have a greater regard to religious
characters than I have hitherto had.</p>

<p>4th. To avoid such company as has a
tendency to unsettle my mind respecting
religious opinions.</p>

<p>5th. To endeavor to preserve a firm reliance
on Divine Providence, and to avoid all
unreasonable worldly care and anxiety.</p>

<p>6th. To pray and guard against loving
my friends with that ardent attachment, and
that implicit reliance upon them, which is
incompatible with supreme love to, and trust
in, God alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>7th. To endeavor to attain a spirit of
forgiveness towards my enemies, and to
banish from my mind all those feelings of
resentment, which are incompatible with
the spirit of the gospel.</p>

<p>For a number of years, no incidents occurred
in the life of Miss Adams which claim
peculiar notice. It is a long road, with only
here and there a milestone. She continued
to write, but on subjects not at all congenial
with her own taste. She was enthusiastic,
and a great lover of poetry and fiction; but
on these subjects she distrusted herself, and
made it her constant study to accommodate her
mind to common life. Her History of New
England is evidence of her perseverance in
this purpose, as that work was undertaken
soon after the second edition of her ‘View
of Religious Opinions.’</p>

<p>In her memoirs, she mentions her difficulty
of procuring books that would aid her in her
purposes. The very uncommon faculty
she possessed of comprehending, and making
her own, the information a book contained,
greatly assisted her labors. She was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
invited to pass a week or two at the late
President Adams’s, at Quincy, with the offer
of his library as an inducement to accept the
invitation. He was much struck with the
rapidity with which she went through folios
of the venerable Fathers; and made some
pleasant remarks in consequence, which induced
her to speak of their contents. He
then found, that, while she had been turning
over leaf after leaf, she had been culling
all that could be useful in her labors. She
possessed the power of application to an
uncommon degree, and was often so entirely
engrossed in her subject, as to be unconscious
of the lapse of time. This abstraction
gave rise to many little anecdotes. It
was said that she often spent days at the
Atheneum; and that the librarian, after
some ineffectual attempts to disengage her
from her book, would lock the door, go home
to his dinner, and return again, and find her
in the same spot; and unconscious either of
his absence, or that the dinner hour was past.
A friend repeated this account to her, and
asked her if it was true. She said in reply,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
‘It is very much exaggerated, I don’t think
it ever happened more than once or twice.’</p>

<p>It was on a visit to Boston, that Miss
Adams first saw <abbr title="mister">Mr</abbr> Buckminster. He was
then at college, and about sixteen years old.
Those who knew him will not think her
description of him an exaggerated one. ‘He
had then,’ she said, ‘the bloom of health on
his cheek, and the fire of genius in his eye.
I did not know from which world he came,
whether from heaven or earth.’ Though so
young, he entered fully into her character;
and before they parted, he gave her a short,
but comprehensive sketch of the state of
literature in France and Germany. After he
became the Pastor of Brattle street Church,
he, with <abbr title="mister">Mr</abbr> Higginson, and <abbr title="mister">Mr</abbr> Shaw the
active founder of the Atheneum, proposed
to Miss Adams, who, from an enfeebled
constitution, had begun to grow infirm, to
remove to Boston; at the same time procuring
for her, through the liberal subscription
of a few gentlemen, an annuity for life.
She had then commenced her History of the
Jews; and nothing could have been more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
favorable to its progress, or to her own ease
of mind, than this benevolent arrangement.
She could never speak of her benefactors
without deep emotion.</p>

<p>From the <abbr title="reverend.">Rev.</abbr> <abbr title="mister">Mr</abbr> Buckminster she received
the most judicious, and extensive
assistance. She was in the habit of visiting
him in his study, and had his permission to
come when she pleased, to sit and read
there as long as she pleased, or take any
book home and use it like her own. Perhaps
people are never perfectly easy with each
other, till they feel at liberty to be silent in
each other’s society. It was stipulated between
them, that neither party should be
obliged to talk. But her own language will
best describe her feelings. ‘<abbr title="mister">Mr</abbr> Buckminster
would sometimes read for hours without
speaking. But, occasionally, flashes of genius
would break forth in some short observation,
or sudden remark, which electrified me.
I never could have gone on with my history,
without the use of his library. I was indebted
to him for a new interest in life.
He introduced me to a valuable circle of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
friends; and it was through him that I became
acquainted with Mrs Dearborn, whose
kindness and attention to me have been
unceasing. His character was the perfection
of humanity. His intellectual powers were
highly cultivated and ennobled. Yet even
the astonishing vigor and brightness of his
intellect were outdone by the goodness of
his heart.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘No thought within his generous mind had birth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But what he might have own’d to heaven and earth.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><abbr title="mister">Mr</abbr> Buckminster assisted Miss Adams’s
researches, and procured information for her,
relative to the Jews. He took a warm interest
in this oppressed people, and often
prayed for them during communion service,
in the same language in which Jesus had
prayed for them. ‘Father, forgive them! for
they know not what they do.’ For about
two years after the removal of Miss Adams
to Boston, she enjoyed this intercourse, visiting
his study with the utmost freedom.</p>

<p>It is impossible not to look back with admiration
upon the benevolence that prompted
these kind attentions; and it is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
a difficult effort of imagination to enter
the library, and to view these laborious,
and dissimilar students together. The
<em>one</em>, distinguished by the natural ease,
grace and elegance of his manners; the
<em>other</em>, timid and helpless. The one,
treading with the elastic step of youth, and
the other declining into the vale of years;
yet both drawn together by those sympathies,
which spring from the fountain of
perfect and everlasting good. Who would
not be touched by the spectacle of a
young man of distinguished talents, equally
sought by the world of <em>science</em>, and of <em>fashion</em>,
extending a helping hand, and devoting
a portion of his valuable time, to a timid
and helpless female, shrinking from the ills of
life; but who indeed derived her happiness
from the same sources that he did, literature
and religion! When, from indisposition, she
omitted for any length of time her visits, a
kind note, or a still kinder call alleviated the
infirmities of her health. But this happiness
was not to last. Miss Adams was only
one among the many who beheld <abbr title="mister">Mr</abbr> Buckminster<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
disappear, at the early age of
twenty-eight years, ‘in all the brightness of
his honors, and without any twilight coming
over his fame.’</p>

<p>Miss Adams corresponded with literary
characters both abroad and at home, but
she never preserved any copies of her own
letters. She wrote with great simplicity,
and singleness of heart, without any display,
and set no value on her own composition.
She had, indeed, a singular standard of
judging. It was her firm persuasion, that
she never wrote anything original. ‘It
is other people’s thoughts,’ said she,
‘that I put into my own language.’ Were
all writers brought to the same test,
there are few that could claim much originality
of thought; though the rich and varied
modes of expression, and the different
views which different minds take of fundamental
truths, often give them the grace
and charm of novelty. In this opinion
of herself, however, she seems to refute
her position; as it must be acknowledged
that this view of her own works is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
rather <em>original</em> among authors. Her defect
was, underrating, instead of overrating her
powers. Her mind was like a well cultivated
garden, stored with fruits and flowers, and
watered by pure streams. But they were
streams that flowed on just as nature had
intended. There were no cascades, nor
fountains, nor serpentine walks, nor rare exotics.
All was simple, and natural.</p>

<p>Her timidity was excessive. It pervaded
her whole character, and sometimes palsied
the efforts of her mind. In her youth she
amused herself with writing tales of fiction.
‘But,’ she said, ‘they all took their color
from her own life. She could do nothing
but kill and destroy; and when her situation
became happier, and her mind more cheerful,
she could not endure the sight of them.’
When very young, her health being in a
feeble state, and not expecting to live long,
she determined to write a number of letters
to her young friends, after the manner of
Mrs Rowe’s; intending they should reach
them mysteriously, immediately on her death.
But fortunately for the Jews, and for literature,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
her anticipations were not realized.
She was early in life much in the habit of
committing poetry to memory; and this she
never forgot. ‘I could repeat poetry,’ said
she, ‘I believe for three months together;
and though I am now continually troubled
by forgetting where I have laid a knife, a
pencil, or a pen, yet the long poems I learned
in my youth, I can repeat as accurately as
ever.’ She went on to observe, that these
recollections did not give her so much
pleasure as might be supposed; for, as this
poetry was selected when she was young,
much of it was not of a kind which her maturer
taste and judgment could approve.</p>

<p>Though Miss Adams was born and bred
in the country, she felt the strongest enthusiasm
for rural scenes; and they always
seemed to retain the power of novelty over
her mind. A walk, a ride, or a visit to any
new place, awoke all the fervor of her
feelings. It was on one of these occasions
that she composed the following lines.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Such scenes the days of innocence renew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And bring the patriarchal age to view,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus favor’d Abraham, in the days of old,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On flowery Mamre kept his fleecy fold;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While friendly angels left their heavenly seat,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To greet the patriarch in his calm retreat.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There are few who were more calculated
for the enjoyment of friendship
and society than Miss Adams. Yet for
a long period she seems to have been in
a great measure deprived of both. It is
difficult to say what effects might have been
produced by the action of other minds upon
her own. It might have roused it to more
inventive exertion; or, on the other hand, in
the fulness of enjoyment, her mental powers
might have sunk into indolence. But
one thing is certain, that her happiness would
have been greatly increased by it. Those
who knew her only late in life can fully realize
how much she must have felt the want
of a friend, after the death of her sister.
Her strong sensibility to all that was excellent,
and good, and fair in creation, peculiarly
fitted her for that intercourse of thought
and feeling, which such emotions naturally
call forth. Her love of literature was no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
doubt a high source of enjoyment. But perhaps
even this might have been increased,
by those occasional restraints which the
forms and habits of society impose. The
epicure is willing to delay his dinner for an
appetite; and, upon the same principle, those
who read, write, or reflect with the greatest
relish, may return to these occupations
with tenfold enjoyment, after giving an hour
or two to a social circle, or even to the dull
round of a modern tea party. But Miss
Adams had none of these incentives. She
was at liberty to read, or write, with
out interruption; to turn over huge folios,
or musty manuscripts, from morning to
night; and if she sometimes suspended her
labors, and walked abroad, it was for a solitary
pleasure. Yet she allowed no sentiment
of repining, or of discontent, to embitter
her life; for she fully realized that,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘It is th’ allotment of the skies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The hand of the Supremely Wise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That guides and governs our affections</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And plans and orders our connexions;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Directs us in our distant road,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And marks the bounds of our abode.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>
<p class="p2">This feeling of resignation to existing
circumstances prevented Miss Adams from
making any strenuous exertions to improve
her condition. Once, indeed, she projected
a plan of keeping a circulating library at
Salem. She had a considerable number of
books to begin with, and probably encouraged
a hope that she might in this way become
instrumental to the promotion of religious
and moral instruction. But she never
thought superficially on any subject; and
before engaging in active measures, she
made full inquiry into the probable success
and consequences of her plan. It was then
that her upright, and conscientious mind,
relinquished the undertaking. The reflection,
that the emoluments of a circulating
library are drawn from novels, plays,
and romances, and that, in keeping such a
library, she must be accessory to much waste
of time, if not perversion of taste and even
of principle, by disseminating works which
often are read because they are new, determined
her conduct. She felt, and lamented
the injury, which the promiscuous reading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
of similar works had produced on her own
mind. While they had sharpened her sensibility
to the evils of life, they had also enervated
her resolution to endure them; and
she ascribed much of her mental suffering
to this cause. She would not, therefore,
pursue the plan of a circulating library,
though encouraged to do it by some warm-hearted
friends. Had the Waverley novels
made their appearance in her youthful days,
they would probably have rendered harmless
the greater part of those which fell into
her hands. Their just historical painting,
their strong delineation of character, and
masterly touches of passion and feeling,
united with the exquisite description of what
is beautiful and sublime in the scenery of
nature, could not fail to have given her a
juster taste, and directed her enthusiasm
to a higher mark. Her own good sense,
led her, in time, to discriminate, and to
separate the gold from the dross; and she
never ceased to derive great pleasure from
a well written work of fiction. Her whole
testimony, however, was given against that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
promiscuous reading of novels, which has
been in times past, more than of late years,
permitted among young girls. The rapid
progress of education, by occupying the
time, and expanding the mind, has done
much towards the correction of this evil. Many
now sip at the fountain-head of elegant literature,
and feel the beauty of Virgil, and the
sublimity of Dante, in their native languages;
listen to the sweet melody of Tasso; and find
in the christian leader of the early ages, Godfrey,
a hero far surpassing the heroes of
modern romances.</p>

<p>Happily the time has arrived, when the
cultivation of female intellect needs no longer
to be advocated, or recommended. It
is now placed on a just and rational ground.
We hear no longer of the <em>alarming</em>, and
perhaps justly obnoxious din, of the ‘rights
of women.’ Whatever their capacity of
receiving instruction may be, there can be no
use in extending it beyond the sphere of
their duties. Yet how wide a circle does
this include! Who can doubt the sacred and
important duties of a mother? ‘Nature has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
not more evidently assigned them the task
of nourishing the body of the infant, than
she has that of developing, and cultivating
the mind, in its earlier stages.’ It is her
office to sow the first seeds of virtue; to
regulate the first excitements of temper; to
cultivate gentleness, forbearance, disinterestedness,
and above all, obedience. For
this, her own habits must be those of careful
observation, of steady self-government,
and of systematical arrangement; otherwise,
her plan will be made up of miscellaneous
feelings, and opinions, that will be constantly
fluctuating.</p>

<p>‘It may be doubted whether any one can
be placed in so insulated a situation, as to
possess a right of appropriating any considerable
portion of his time to studies, which
may not terminate in a practical result.’
This rule, in an enlightened sense, ought to
be the standard of a woman’s education.
It ought to be the measure of her cultivation.
But surely no faculty of her mind can
be spared from this work. ‘She is designed
by nature for elegance, and gentleness;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
to endear domestic life to man, to make
virtue lovely to her children, to spread around
her order and grace, and to give society its
highest polish. No attainment can be above
beings whose end and aim is to accomplish
these important purposes. Every means
should be used to invigorate by principle, and
culture, their native excellence and grace.’<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> Fenelon.</p>

</div>

<p>These observations may be deemed irrelevant,
but they are suggested by Miss Adams’s
own remarks on this subject. She
often regretted the time she had spent in
useless, and desultory reading and observed
that when she first began to turn her attention
to the study of the dead languages, she
felt as if she was ‘drawing upon herself the
ridicule of society.’ She lived, however,
to see these prejudices removed, and to receive
a respect and deference from literary
men, which often excited her astonishment,
as well as gratitude. There have been many
instances recorded, of talent which has
been suffered to languish in obscurity and
want. Against these, the present instance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
ought not to pass unnoticed. The individual
kindness that Miss Adams received was
invariable. She had outlived almost all her
contemporaries. But new generations had
sprung up under the enlightened influences of
education, who respected her intellect and
learning, and who loved her for her goodness.
After her removal to Boston, she was
therefore seldom long in solitude. Her little
apartment was usually decorated with the
flowers that her young friends brought her.
Many of them spent hours in reading to her,
and cheered her by their bright and animated
conversation. It would be injustice,
also, not to refer to the disinterested, and
liberal assistance she received from those
friends, who enabled her to reserve a part
of her laborious earnings for the benefit of
a suffering relative. The annuity, which
continued to her death, was said to have
been first suggested by ladies; but afterwards,
the proposal was put into the hands
of <abbr title="mister">Mr</abbr> Shaw, and the other gentlemen mentioned
in her memoirs. A few years previous
to her death, a number of ladies at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
Salem sent her an annual sum as a testimony
of their respect.</p>

<p>At one period of her life, her correspondents
were numerous. Amongst them might
be mentioned names, that will long be cherished
by posterity. The venerable President
Adams, to whom the second edition of
her View of Religions was dedicated, took
a benevolent interest in her literary success.
From one of his letters to her, the following
sentence is extracted.</p>

<p>‘You and I are undoubtedly related by
birth; and although we were both “born in
humble obscurity,” yet I presume neither of
us have any cause to regret that circumstance.
If I could ever suppose that family
pride was in any case excusable, I should
think a descent from a line of virtuous independent
New England farmers, for one
hundred and sixty years, was a better foundation
for it, than a descent through royal
or titled scoundrels ever since the flood.’</p>

<p>With the learned Bishop Gregoire, whose
name is familiar in our country as well as
his own, her correspondence continued many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
years. The congeniality of their labors
in the cause of the Jews, as well as general
philanthropy, had made them acquainted
with each other. With <abbr title="mister">Mr</abbr> Cunningham,
also, Vicar of Harrow, and author of ‘The
World without Souls,’ she exchanged letters.
From Miss More she received several, all of
which she most highly prized. The late
Mrs Catharine Cappe was among her correspondents;
nor can we omit to mention
her letters from the amiable, and distinguished
Swedenborgian, <abbr title="mister">Mr</abbr> Hill. There is one
also among her papers from the venerable
Bishop Carroll, in reply to a letter of
hers addressed to him. It is with no narrow
feeling we mention names like these.
We ask not their sect or country. They
belong to the great family of mankind, and
we claim affinity as a rightful inheritance.</p>

<p>The strength of Miss Adams’s natural affection
was proportionate to her social ties.
Of her only remaining sister, and to whom
her memoir is bequeathed in the ‘humble
hope that it may be a pecuniary benefit to
her,’ she often spoke with deep and irrepressible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
feeling. She sometimes projected
plans, by which she might have enjoyed
more of the society of her nieces; but she
submitted to the necessity which separated
her from her relatives without a murmur.
One of her nieces was adopted, and educated
by a lady, who fell a victim to consumption
in the prime of life. Here recollection
lingers for a moment. Impelled by a
powerful sense of duty, this lady quitted her
nearest friend, and sought, in the milder
climate of Italy, that health and freedom of
respiration which were denied her here.
She was able to derive much enjoyment
from her short residence in a land that
abounded with objects congenial to her taste;
but only lived to return, and yield her last
breath in her native country.</p>

<p>As Miss Adams has mentioned her works
in her memoir, in the order in which they
were written, it is unnecessary to say more of
them. They have been reviewed, and
weighed, by a candid public; and met at the
time the wants of the different departments
in which they were written. Her History of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
New England was a pioneer to many similar
works that followed. There is, however,
one work of hers, published in 1804, which
is less known. It is entitled, ‘The Truth
and Excellence of the Christian Religion
exhibited.’ This work contains interesting,
and short sketches of the lives of eminent
laymen, who have written in defence
of the Christian religion, with extracts from
their writings. The characters are selected
with judgment and taste, and every circumstance
is omitted that does not aid her
purpose. From the preface to ‘The Truth
and Excellence of the Christian Religion,’
written by the author, we select one passage.
‘In order to prevent any misrepresentation
of the design of this compilation, it
may be proper to inform the reader, that
these great names, and the testimonies they
have given of their firm belief of the truth
of Christianity, are not adduced to justify a
reliance upon human authority, or to establish
the divinity of the christian system; but
the evidences of revealed religion are still
submitted to, and boldly challenge, the strictest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
scrutiny, by the known and established
rules of right reason.’ In connexion with
this idea, she quotes the following lines from
Cowper.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent14">‘“Philosophy baptized</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the pure fountain of eternal love,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Has eyes indeed; and, viewing all she sees,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As meant to indicate a God to man,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gives him the praise, and forfeits not her own.”’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The order and systematic arrangement of
this work is excellent. It was principally
intended for the use of young persons; and
the characters selected are not wanting in
that sort of interest, which is suited to make
them attractive to the young. The following
anecdote is there related of Grotius.</p>

<p>‘This great man was twice sent on embassies
to England. On his return to Holland,
he found the religious divisions which
had for some time prevailed in that country
increased. By his attachment to Barnevelt
and the remonstrant party, he incurred the
displeasure of Prince Maurice of Orange.
In 1669, he was seized and sentenced to perpetual
imprisonment, and his estate was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
confiscated. In pursuance of this sentence,
he was imprisoned in the strong castle of
Louvestein; and after having been treated
with great rigor for more than a year and a
half, he was rescued by a stratagem of his
wife. He had been permitted to borrow
books of his friends; and when he had perused
them, they were carried back in a chest
with his linen, which was in this way sent
to be washed. During the first year, the
guards were exact in examining the chest;
but at length grew remiss, and did not take
the trouble to open it. His wife, who belonged
to one of the first families in Zealand,
and was worthy of such a husband as
Grotius, observing their negligence, advised
him to bore holes in the chest to prevent his
being stifled, and then to put himself into
it, and to make his escape. She requested
the governor of the castle to permit her to
send away a chest. After her request was
granted, Grotius was put into the chest, and
conveyed to a friend’s house in Gorkum,
where, dressing himself like a mason, and
taking a rule and trowel, he passed through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
the market place, and stepping into a boat,
went to Brabant. There he discovered himself
to some of his friends, and hired a carriage
at Antwerp. At first there was a design
of prosecuting his wife, who remained
in the prison. However, she was released
by a plurality of voices, and universally applauded
for a resolution and courage which
saved her husband’s life, while it endangered
her own.’</p>

<p>It would be a pleasant office, in paying
this tribute to the memory of a friend, to
record the names of many whose kindness
and attention to her were unremitting.
Some, like herself, have gone to their long
home; but others still remain, to continue
their ‘noiseless deeds of worth.’ One
little incident, which greatly interested her
from the mystery attached to it, is a reason
for mentioning the name of a lady who is
now no more, but who was distinguished for
endowments of mind and person. She
married and went to Europe during the revolutionary
war. After passing many years
in England, Scotland and France, she returned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
to this country, with a mind fraught
with practical knowledge, a heart full of
benevolence, and blest with that happy talent
of conversation, that draws forth from
the recipient as much as it communicates.
In this lady’s society Miss Adams took the
greatest delight. During their long and
pleasant intercourse of many years, an artist
waited on Miss Adams, and requested her to
sit for a miniature picture of herself: saying
that he was commissioned to solicit the
favor by a friend. She consented, but was
entirely at a loss to conjecture who the
friend could be. The picture was completed,
and in the course of a few weeks
sent to her, with the following note.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">My dear Madam</span>—I send you the miniature
for which you had the goodness to
sit. It has been generally recognised, and
thought a good likeness. I hope it will be
as much approved in your room, as it has been
in mine. Now, my dear Madam, you will
discover the friend who was desirous that
you should <em>live</em> in future, in <em>person</em> as well as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
in <em>mind</em>. I sincerely hope others may feel
as I do on this subject; and a more valuable
portrait be secured of the lady, whose talents
and writings have diffused so much useful
knowledge, and whose conduct and life has
been so exemplary. After it has been with
you long enough for your friends to see it, I
wish it returned, and to have the honor of
its hanging in my house. If one better calculated
for the purpose should not hereafter
be taken, I shall bequeath it to the Athenæum.</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 6em;">With great respect,</span><br>
<span style="margin-right: 3.5em;">Your friend and servant,</span><br>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;"><span class="smcap">Catharine Hay</span>.</span></p>
<p class="p0">
<span class="smcap">Boston, Dec. 25, 1822.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p class="p2">The hope of this lady was accomplished.
A few years before Miss Adams’s death,
through the influence of a few friends, a fine
likeness of her was taken by <abbr title="mister">Mr</abbr> Harding,
and was afterwards presented by them to the
Athenæum.</p>

<p>We hope it may not be deemed improper
to mention one other friend, whose life was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
a series of benevolent and disinterested exertions.
Immediately previous to Miss Adams’s
illness, she spoke of this friend with
her accustomed interest; and with an anticipation
that they should be fellow-travellers
to the land of spirits. Mrs Codman’s
death took place a few days after that of
Miss Adams. She has left to her friends
those sweet and sacred remembrances, that
soften and elevate the heart; while the
influence of her intelligent, and liberal mind,
will long be felt in the society in which she
lived.</p>

<p>The most prominent trait in Miss Adams’s
character was sensibility. It was impossible
to converse with her any length of time,
without touching some of the numerous
chords that vibrated through her system.
An instrument thus organized did not require
the skill of an artist to set it in motion.
The feeblest hand could extract notes of joy,
sorrow, or apprehension. It responded to every
breath that passed over it. This sensitiveness
sometimes put her at the mercy of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
the unfeeling and obtrusive. But, generally
speaking, her sensibility was a source of great
enjoyment. Towards her friends it flowed
forth in an affection fervent and enthusiastic.
‘The sight of them,’ to use her own expression,
‘was like the sun and air of Heaven.’
All that was remotely connected with them
became important to her. Those who have
heard her speak of <abbr title="mister">Mr</abbr> Thacher, the eloquent
and feeling historian of her friend <abbr title="mister">Mr</abbr> Buckminster,
understood the nature of her emotions.
She almost identified him with the
being that he so beautifully and justly delineated.
Brothers indeed they were in the
sacred ties of love and harmony, and in
those qualities of mind that emanate from
the source of perfect wisdom and goodness.
There are many who may apply to both that
touching sentence the survivor applied to his
friend; ‘Even now, when time has interposed
to subdue all the more powerful emotions
of grief, there are those who delight
to recall the hours we have passed with
<em>them</em>, and to dwell on those traits, which we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
loved while living, and which death cannot
efface from our memories.’</p>

<p><abbr title="mister">Mr</abbr> Thacher, unlike his friend, was doomed
to see death approach by slow and faltering
steps. If there is a trial on earth that
mocks the power of human fortitude, it is to
feel the usefulness of life cut off, and to be
compelled to remain idle during the toils of
the day, while cares and labors are thronging
around. How nobly he endured this affliction,
how justly he reasoned that the part
assigned him was to <em>wait</em>, must be well remembered.
The teachings of Heaven are
as various as our wants. This sublime example
of patient endurance has found its way
to many a heart, and spoken more forcibly
than the services even of an active ministry
could have done. His fervent prayer is now
accomplished. He has gone to that world
where ‘friendship is uninterrupted, and virtue
eternal.’</p>

<p>We bless God for the natural evidence of
a future life, which minds like these, bearing
the visible stamp of immortality, afford; we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
bless him that such have existed, and we
bless him that such have preceded those
whom we love, to cast brightness over the
dark valley of death.</p>

<p>We hope this involuntary digression will
be pardoned, and we return again to the
subject of our memoir. We have spoken of
her sensibility and elsewhere of her humility.
This, however, must not be mistaken for that
slothful quiescent sense of inferiority, which
sometimes belongs to common minds. It
was true christian humility; it was the consciousness
of high moral capacities, falling
far short of her exalted standard of excellence.
The sensibility that led her so fully
to appreciate the kindness of her friends,
made her alive to injury. At any attempt at
imposition, her spirit rose proportionably, and
she expressed and felt a resentment for which
she afterwards reproached herself.</p>

<p>Her judgment and opinion of books was
derived from her own power of thought. She
did not wait for the decision of others, but expressed
her own fearlessly, when called for.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
But it was on the subject of character that
her mind discovered most acuteness and originality.
Even in those whom she loved, she
knew how to discriminate, and when she
allowed herself to speak on the subject,
plainly discovered that she knew how to
separate the good from the evil, and that
she had learned to love them with their
faults.</p>

<p>The last visit that Miss Adams made was
to South Boston, in the family of the Superintendent
of Juvenile Offenders. There
was much in her short residence there to
interest her mind. The success of this institution;
the groups of rescued children,
now cheerful and obedient; the disinterested
kindness of the family; nor ought it to be
forgotten, the beautiful situation of the building,
overlooking the bay of Boston with its
many islands, the harbor and city rising in
its pyramid of beauty, and crowned by the
dome of the State-house; all called forth
her enthusiasm, and brightened the last days
of her earthly existence. When she returned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
to her lodgings in Boston, she lamented
the want of sun and of prospect. By the
instrumentality of judicious friends, she was
removed to Brookline; and when there, she
wrote the following note to a friend, which,
as the <em>last</em> effort of her pen, is here inserted.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>—Will you excuse me if
I trouble you with a few lines. I am now
settled for the winter, <em>if I live</em>. The greatest
earthly happiness I can enjoy is seeing
my friends, among whom dear Mrs —— is
in the first rank. I need not inform you,
and I am unable to express, how much pleasure
it would give me to see you in Brookline.
The lady I am now boarding with is
all goodness. My trembling hand will
scarcely allow me to write. Adieu, dear
Madam; pray call upon me as soon as you
can conveniently.</p>

<p class="right">From your affectionate and grateful friend,<br>
<span class="smcap">H. Adams</span>.</p>
<p class="p0">
<span class="smcap">Brookline, Nov. 12, 1831.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p class="p2">The friend to whom the note was addressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
hastened to see her. She found her
in a large, and airy apartment. It was
a fine morning; one of those days in which
‘Autumn seems to linger in the lap of Winter.’
The sun poured its rays into her
apartment to her heart’s content. She was
bright, and cheerful, and said with a smile
she ‘believed some people thought she had
lived long enough; but she was willing to
remain as long as it pleased God to continue
her,’ and then added, pointing to the
prospect without, ‘how can any body be
impatient to quit such a beautiful world!’</p>

<p>But little remains to be added to this
short sketch, and that little perhaps is expressed
in the Obituary notice which we
subjoin.</p>


<h3>OBITUARY.</h3>

<p>Died at Brookline, near Boston, on the
15th inst. <span class="smcap">Miss Hannah Adams</span>, aged seventysix.
Her literary labors have been long
before the public, and have made her name
known in Europe as well as in her native<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
land. Her first work, the ‘View of Religions,’
was published at a time when this
country had few authors, and when a book
from a female hand was almost without precedent.
She was not impelled by any desire
of fame; and though the hope of usefulness
was undoubtedly a strong motive to
her literary exertions, yet this would not
have availed, without the prospect of contributing
by her pen to her own support, and the
comfort of her nearest friends. It is gratifying
to know, that she has left behind a
simple and interesting memoir of her early
life, which precludes the necessity of saying
more of her literary history. Indeed, <em>literary</em>
claims are perhaps among the last that, at
a moment like this, present themselves to the
minds of her friends. The virtues and excellences
of her character, her blameless life,
her sensibility, the warmth of her affections,
her sincerity and candor, call forth a flow of
feeling that cannot be restrained. To an almost
child-like simplicity, and singleness of
heart, she united a clear and just conception<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
of character; to a deep and affecting humility,
a dignity and elevation of thought,
that commanded the respect and veneration
of those around her. Amidst many infirmities
she retained the freshness and enthusiasm
of youth. Society never lost its charms.
To the aged she listened with submission and
gentleness; to the classic and highly gifted,
with a delight almost amounting to rapture.
The young, and there were such who felt
it a privilege to ‘sit at her feet,’ she viewed
as ‘ministering angels’ dispensing joy and
gladness. Her love of nature was exhaustless.
The first beam of morning, the glory
of noon, the last rays of the setting sun, were
objects which through a long life she never
contemplated with indifference. Those
who were in the habit of visiting her, will
recollect how constantly her apartment was
decorated by flowers of the field, or the garden.
It was her object to gather round her
images of natural and moral beauty. In
many respects her mind seemed so truly constituted
for enjoyment, that to those who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
knew her but slightly, she might have appeared
to be exempted from that mental
discipline, which is gradually leading the
pilgrim on to the land of promise. But her
friends knew otherwise; they knew how
keen was her religious sensibility, how
tremblingly alive her conscience, how high
her standard of excellence, and how great
her timidity and self-distrust, and they felt
that this was not her haven of rest.</p>

<p>Though Miss Adams’s faith was fervent
and devout, it partook of the constitution of
her sensitive mind, rather than gave the tone
to it. Yet amidst moments of doubt and despondency,
a passage from scripture, or a
judicious observation, would disperse the
clouds that had gathered round her, and the
brightest sunshine would diffuse itself over
her mind and countenance. There are many
who will sorrow that they shall see her
‘face no more;’ but those who knew the
peculiar delicacy of her constitution, ought
rather to rejoice that she has escaped from
the present inclement winter; from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
stormy wind and tempest; that her eyes have
opened upon ‘one eternal Spring,’ a season
that always awoke the enthusiasm of her
nature, and which she said seemed to her
‘like the first freshness of creation.’</p>

<p>It was her happiness to have been conversant
with some of the most enlightened and
gifted men of the age. From many she received
essential benefit; and the universal
sympathy and respect, as well as the individual
kindness which she excited, are testimonies
honorable to human nature. Many
in whom she delighted have passed away.
To those she has gone, and to the Father
and Saviour whom she loved.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The last tribute of respect is, however,
yet to be paid to the honored subject of this
notice. Her remains are to be removed to
Mount Auburn, near Boston, the spot selected
for a cemetery. Subscriptions for a monument
to her memory have been raised, and
it will be erected in the spring. There
seems to be almost a poetical unity in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
arrangement; that one who so devoutly</p>

combining so much natural beauty; and
which possesses that magnificence of wood
and water, which bespeaks it ‘a temple
not made with hands.’</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
